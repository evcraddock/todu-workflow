# PR Review Common Logic

Shared review logic for all hosts.

## Required Inputs

- task ID (required)
- PR title/body
- PR diff

## Procedure

1. Load task details via `task-show` using the provided task ID.
2. Extract task objective and acceptance criteria from the task description.
3. Review PR changes against each acceptance criterion.
   - mark each criterion as: `met` | `partial` | `not-evident`
4. Run quality checks during review:
   - scope alignment
   - code quality and maintainability
   - tests for logic changes
   - security concerns
   - documentation impact
5. Decide exactly one outcome:
   - `approved`
   - `warnings`
   - `changes-requested`

## Decision Rules

- Any acceptance criterion marked `not-evident` => `changes-requested`
- Missing tests for logic changes => `changes-requested`
- Potential bugs/correctness issues => `changes-requested`
- Policy violations => `changes-requested`
- `warnings` only for non-blocking concerns

## Required Review Content

Review comment content must include:
- summary
- acceptance criteria checklist with per-criterion status
- blocking issues (if any)
- warnings (if any)
- final verdict

## Common Result Fields
