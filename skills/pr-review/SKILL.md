# PR Review

Review a PR and stop before merge.

## Inputs

- PR number
- task ID (required)

## Steps

1. Validate task ID is provided.
   - if missing, stop as `BLOCKED`
2. Detect host from `origin` remote.
   - GitHub => follow `./pr-gh-review.md`
   - otherwise => follow `./pr-fj-review.md`
3. Use worker output as source of truth.
   - required: `pr=open`
   - required: `pr_comment=posted`
   - required: `task_comment=posted`
   - required: criteria fields reported (`criteria_total`, `criteria_met`, `criteria_missing`)
   - if required artifacts are missing: status is not complete
4. Report outcome and stop at merge gate.
   - `approved` => wait for explicit human merge approval
   - `warnings` => fix by default unless human waives
   - `changes-requested` => fix and rerun review

## Rules

- Never merge in this skill.
- Never claim completion while required artifacts are missing.
- Do not phrase required next steps as optional.
